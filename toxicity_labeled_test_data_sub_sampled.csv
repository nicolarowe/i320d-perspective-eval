   dbadvert tag on KPDFCA   Wow Doesnt seem to speak of anything useful is quite a bold indictment Its also an opinion disputed by many and a sweeping generalization If you look at the edit logs youll see that several editors had a hand in this article Imperfect as it is it is certainly not blatant advertising and does not meet the criteria for speedy deletion Even if you think something is advertising please consider a standard AfD listing instead to give contributors to that article a chance to respond and defend it Better yet consider an unreferenced tag A word to the wise is sufficient and its much better to improve a deficient article than to delete one See the 3rd bullet point in the things to bear in mind paragraph of the etiquette guideline The tag has been removed not by me but by another contributor and member of TelevisionStationsProject  ,no

  JWs arent a group of the Bible Student movement They dont even acknowledge the continued existence of the Bible Student movement The beliefs of Jehovahs Witnesses are distinctly divergent from those of the Bible Student movement which adhere to the teachings of Charles Taze Russell The claim that it is like Jesus shouldnt be mentioned in articles about Lutherans is not analogous at all the correct analogy would be that Jesus shouldnt be stated as the founder of Lutheranism  ,no
  I dont care if you have not inserted those numbers the fact is that you are turning a blind eye to it As for the 2 sources I placed here Novinite published that article in november 2010 hardly outdated whilst the academic source Brizic  Yamur was published in 2008 Where an earth are you getting 1996 from Neither of these sources mention 1996 Unless you can backup your arguments with citations Im just not interested Ae I said before Ill give you a day because I do not like editwars and wish to give you some time  ,no

Thanks for the wiki page ref on Maurice Samuel note spelling I wasnt familiar with it Its very thin and somewhat misleading but does sayHe and his work won widespread acclaim in the Jewish community during his lifetime You find it distressing It is neither here nor there whether he had other prejudices those cited and there are worse ones one could dig up from his many books are identical to those of Baruch Goldstein He was a contemporary source for the Jewish community abroad on the events of 1929 at Hebron If you read books instead of wasting time scanning the Internet you would have known that Samuel helped Chaim Weizman on the latters autobiography Weizman esteemed him You dont But that doesnt mean he cant be used as a source  ,no

  Yes  Yes band  This move has already taken place by doing a copypaste Someone needs to delete the Yes band which was a redirect to Yes and then move the Yes to Yes band The reason for this request is that the vast majority of edits to Yes were related to the band and not the word     Yes is currently a simple dictdef  Yes band should be at Yes with a link to Wiktionary for the word     I have no problem with that I didnt move the article I just wanted to get the page history straightened out    Ive reverted it and left a note on the Talk page to bring the argument here and to use the Move tab if it should be moved IMHO someone looking for the word will go to Wiktionary while someone looking for Yes at Wikipedia is more likely looking for the band so I think it should stay that way ie what violetriga said    That works for me    Support move to Yes band Yes should be a disambig See Yes disambiguation for some ideas    1704 2005 Jan 1 UTC  Unless someone presents some other wellknown things known only by the name Yes then the band should be at Yes I see nothing at SpecialAllpagesYes that would be referred to primarily or even occasionally by only the word Yes    I was the original editor and Im willing to admit that I may have goofed  I saw some similarity between Yes and Rush both of which are common words with other uses but I admit that the band may be the commonest use of Yes  A quick search at IMDB for instance showed one arthouse film some foreign films and a couple of shorts  And I probably didnt wait long enough for a consensus didnt use Move etc  I havent been around here long enough to know which way the precedents point    Yes Support the move  0642 2005 Jan 3 UTC  Support the move As the name of a band Yes will only be known to a minority of readers    Support My rule would be that a secondary meaning always calls for disambiguation   1928 2005 Jan 15 UTC,no

  Its an interesting concept definitely Ive never filled out a census before but I wonder how the question is worded when asking about ancestry To me American ancestry means Native American or relation to the peoples of America prior to European discovery Are people making mistakes in filling it out or answering it in a way not intended by the Census Bureau or is this a legitimate option for answering this question   In reading the lead to the culture section it does seem that race is a better word to use though I dont say that because American ethnicity exists I say that because America as a nation has no one race and there is no American race North America may have or better phrased had races but once you put political boundaries on the map and consider only the United States then no we dont have a race We do have at least some sort of ethnicity though Im not sure its worth rewording the section just to include a link to that article  ,no

  ok i admit it i edited a post that had already been vandalizedunnoticed and uncorrected and quoted my friends comical response to the original vandal For this i recieved a correction from accurizer and when i checked the original post both the original vandal and my response were removed knowing that accurizer checks previous vandalslike me now i suppose history for new possible vandalisms should i take this to mean that if i find other articles to be vandalized that my parodies of the vandal will result in original vandals work being removed Personally I find the actual vandalization to be a problematic if not comical and inevitable result of the wiki to quote my original friend wikipedia is like that dictionary in the public library that everyone writes their thoughts in  this is the same friend that suggests we put fake encyclopedias in the library just to confuse everyone maybe i should stop listening to my friend  good job accurizer for correcting that other guy but not me   D everyone should get a good laugh in at least once day,no

 Turbillys bankruptcy   In his Travels in france during the years 1787 1788  1789 p 112  Arthur Young gave an account on Turbillys bankruptcy  In this work he described that on 29 September he arrived at Tourbilly which he characterized as     a poor village of a few scattered houses in a vale between two rising grounds which are yet heath and waste the chateau in the midst with plantations of fine poplars leading to it  Young recalled   I had read the translation of the marquiss history of his improvements in MrMills husbandry78 and thought it the most interesting morsel I had met with long before I procured the original Memoire sur les defrichemens and determined that if ever I should go to France to view improvements the recital of which had given me such pleasure   First he described the encounter with the then present owner  I had neither letter nor introduction to the present owner the marquis de Galway I therefore stated to him the plain fact that I had read Mons de Tourbillys book with so much pleasure that I wished much to view the improvements described in it he answered me directly in good English received me with such cordiality of politeness and such expressions of regard for the purport of my travels that he put me perfectly in humour with myself and consequently with all around me He ordered breakfast a l Angloise gave orders for a man to attend us in our walk who I desired might be the oldest labourer to be found of the late marquis de Tourbillys I was pleased to hear that one was alive who had worked with him from the beginning of his improvement At breakfast Mons de Galway introduced me to his brother who also spoke English and regretted that he could not do the same to Madame de Galway who was in the straw he then gave me an account of his fathers acquiring the estate and chateau of Tourbilly His greatgrandfather came to Bretagne with King James II when he fled from the English throne some of the same family are still living in the county of Cork particularly at Lotta His father was famous in that province for his skill in agriculture and as a reward for an improvement he had wrought on the landes the states of the province gave him a waste tract in the island of Belleisle which at present belongs to his son Hearing that the marquis de Tourbilly was totally ruined and his estates in Anjou to be sold by the creditors he viewed them and finding the land very improveable made the purchase giving about 15000 louis dors for Tourbilly a price which made the acquisition highly advantageous not withstanding his having bought some lawsuits with the estate It is about 3000 arpents nearly contiguous the seigneury of two parishes with the haute justice c a handsome large and convenient chateau offices very compleat and many plantations the work of the celebrated man concerning whom my enquiries were directed  About Turbillys bankruptcy Young learned  I was almost breathless on the question of so great an improver being ruined You are unhappy that a man should be ruined by an art you love so much Precisely so But he eased me in a moment by adding that if the marquis had done nothing but farm and improve he had never been ruined One day as he was boring to find marl his ill stars discovered a vein of earth perfectly white which on trial did not effervesce with acids It struck him as an acquisition for porcelain  he shewed it to a manufacturer  it was pronounced excellent the marquiss imagination took fire and he thought of converting the poor village of Tourbilly into a town by a fabric of china  he went to work on his own account  raised buildings  and got together all that was necessary except skill and capital  In fine he made good porcelain was cheated by his agents and people and at last ruined A soap manufactory which he established also as well as some lawsuits relative to other estates had their share in causing his misfortunes his creditors seized the estate but permitted him to administer it till his death when it was sold The only part of the tale that lessened my regret was that though married he left no family so that his ashes will sleep in peace without his memory being reviled by an indigent posterity His ancestors acquired the estate by marriage in the fourteenth century His agricultural improvements Mons Galway observed certainly did not hurt him they were not well done nor well supported by himself but they rendered the estate more valuable and he never heard that they had brought him into any difficulties I cannot but observe here that there seems a fatality to attend country gentlemen whenever they attempt trade or manufacture In England I never knew a man of landed property with the education and habits o,no

   Legal Advice on UK Copyright Position   Hi here is some legal advice I got here in the UK regarding copyright from a UK Barrister Senior Lawyer  There is no current UK court ruling that says that copyright exists in the photograph of an out of copyright painting  It all depends on whether the person who took the photograph of the painting made an original contribution if yes they may be able to claim a copyright in the photograph If no original contribution no copyright Originality has not been defined in the Copyright Designs and Patents Act and is open for the courts to interpret on a case by case basis  However there is UK case law which has established that a mechanical photocopy of an original work is not copyrighted Reject Shop Vs Manners 1995 and in the case of Interlego AG vs Tyco Industries 1989 it was held that that a drawing which was a copy of another drawing did not hold its own copyright Skill labour or judgement merely in the process of copying cannot confer originality said the court in this case  So it would seem that Farrer are bluffing  there is no precedent that supports their position  but there are precedents in your favour I very much doubt if they or any other UK gallery would want to take a case to court because the chances are they would lose The only thing stopping people now from scanning images from books postcards and posters is either a mistaken belief that it is illegal or fear that it may be judged to be so  Left on 19th July 2009 bhy Jimbodiddly  Preceding unsigned comment added by      ,no

   In theaters in 1953  on TV in 1955 wrong    The intro states It was released to theaters in 1953 and on television on 1955 Unfortunately this is not possible or at least was a violation of industry regulations at the time The proof is the history of TVs Adventures of Superman The entire first season of 26 episodes with Phyllis Coates instead of Noel Neill as Lois Lane was in effect the pilot being produced on spec and with no guarantee of getting on the air To both promote the project and help defray costs if it did not sell the producers began filming with a twopart episode Unknown People which they quickly released to theaters as a Saturday matinee feature Superman and the Mole Men Once a deal with Kelloggs got them an onair committment the producers discovered that they fell afoul of a regulation that prohibited anything made for and released to theaters after 1948 from being shown on television Consequently Unknown People parts 1  2 were not televised until about 1960 when this rule was repealed and the series was released into general rerun syndication This same rule means that the subject of this article couldor at least shouldnot have been shown on television in 1955 after a 1953 theatrical run The other way around maybe but this has to be wrong I know that neither linkedin article mentions this and the one for the series even contradicts it but Film Fax magazine published a threepart article c2000 that went into great detail on the development and first season production and reported this in no uncertain terms Note also that List of Adventures of Superman episodes gives November 23 1951 as the original airdate for both parts the article on the feature gives this as the date of its theatrical opening even though the series didnt get on the air until September 1952 IMDb does the exact same thing while TVcom almost does giving the date of both parts as December 18 1951 and making minimal acknowledgement of the feature film version When combined the three essentially corroborate a lack of genuine original airdate for the purposes of this discussion only of course So I repeat Commando Cody would have been in violation of industry regulations had it played on TV in 1955 after a 1953 theatrical run Did Republic honcho Herbert Yates break the rules and get away with it which if true is notable and should be pointed out or does this article contain misinformation   ,no

  I found this phrase to be a bit vague The Israeli government attempted to deny responsibility It seems that if the government was attempting to deny responsiblity then they were denying responsiblity so the sentence should simply read The Israeli government denied responsiblity If however the parts of the Israeli government were denying responsiblity and parts werent then this could be characterized as an attempt to deny responsibility as the article says at present This would require a little clarification though and I doubt its the case  Infernallek,no

16 10 October 2011 UTC  declineYou say that you understand the reason for your block and will not do the same again However you have already told us that you knew all along what was wrong with what you were doing and have made it clear that you were willing to accept a short block for it but that the length of this block has gone beyond what you were budgeting for That indicates that the length of this block was fully justified as the shorter one you were expecting would not have been an effective deterrent You have therefore given a very good reason for not unblocking Also it is worth mentioning that you still dont seem to have taken WPNOTTHEM on board   13,no

  Questions about inclination of orbital planes  The article says  All planetary orbital planes wobble around the invariable plane meaning that they rotate around its axis while their inclinations to it vary both of which are caused by the gravitational perturbation of the other planets  Q1 Does this mean that in a hypothetical solar system consisting of only one sun and one planet the orbital plane would necessarily have an inclination of 0 degrees relative to the invariable plane  Observation There no orbital planes with really big inclinations eg 70 degrees In fact the maximum inclination seems to belong to Mercury which tops the charts at a whopping 634 degrees pardon the sarcasm  Q2 So why dont the orbital planes vary more than they do It seems obvious that SOME force is pulling the planets orbital planes towards the invariable plane but Id like to understand this mechanism a bit more  Q3 Is there a reason that the planets closest to the sun also have orbits with greatest inclination,no

 NBA AllStar Celebrity Game   I saw you reverted the ability to translude text from NBA AllStar Celebrity Game into 2015 NBA AllStar Game but you did not provide an edit summary as to why 2015 NBA AllStar Game has summaries of all the AllStar Weekend events and transclusion avoids having to cutandpaste and constantly sync info across articles Is there a reason you object to it,no

Who says this article does need DNA section is nuts  The jews used the semitic right of return in 1950 to give immigration nationality certificates to what became the citizens of Israel on the basis that they are descendents of the Semites  descendents of Abraham of the Bible descendents of The Ancient Israelites who lived in Palestine pre 120AD  that their ancestors were citizens of the area in ancient times any or one of the above  The DNA studies prove that Jews  sephard Mizrahi and Ashkenazim  are not descendents of the ancient Israelites their ancestors never set foot in the Holy Land or near it using the three types of DNA  Y chromosome mtDNA and Autosomal tchromosomes all theree testings found the jews alien to the area and their haplogroups Y DNA mtDNA and Autosomal SNPs are originated in areas far away from the middle East and never been to it in the past  Now if you dont have something you can not give it  right  The current jewshave no ancestry to a man  abraham or otherwise  who lived in Palestine and his descendents or adherents LIVED in that Area so even if spiritual ancestry does not exist  claiming that a pool of different people claimed Israelite status still does not fly either,no
